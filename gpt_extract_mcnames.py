"""
Shows the original and pending strings to ChatGPT and asks it to extract the names of Minecraft things, as well as what those things were translated to. This data is then cleaned up and checked against Minecraft's official translations to detect inconsistencies. ChatGPT misses a few names, but it works pretty well overall.
